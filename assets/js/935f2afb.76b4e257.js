At a high level, mining in Spacemesh works like it does in other blockchains: smeshers provably spend scarce resources in order to obtain eligibilities to participate in block production at certain points in time, are rewarded with coins for following the rules of the protocol and contributing to block production, and are punished for violating these rules.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/spacemesh":{"id":"learn/spacemesh","title":"What Is Spacemesh?","description":"Spacemesh is a decentralized peer-to-peer network which serves as a public ledger to allow for the transaction of cryptographic assets including coins.

The API is split into two separate instances, one public and one private, each of which implements several services that can be turned on or off at will. \\"Public\\" services provide readonly access to data such as node status, epochs/layers/blocks/transactions, account state, etc., whereas \\"private\\" services allow the operator to change the params of a running node, e.g., the smesher coinbase or the set of PoET servers. While \\"public\\" endpoints are theoretically safe to open for public API calls, in practice we strongly recommend that no API services be exposed publicly. The API design and implementation have not been hardened against denial of service attacks and represent an attack vector against a running node. For this reason, you should run both the public and private API instances on private interfaces (e.g., the loopback/127.0.0.1 interface) and/or put them behind a firewall.","sidebar":"start"},"start/smesher/equivocation":{"id":"start/smesher/equivocation","title":"Avoiding Equivocation","description":"There\'s a very small set of behaviors that a miner in Spacemesh is punished for. If a miner simply goes offline or fails to publish a proposal when they\'re eligible to do so they\'ll miss some rewards but they\'re not punished per se. However, if a miner double votes, otherwise known as equivocation, their miner identity is permanently disqualified from participation in consensus and from earning rewards in the future. In a permissionless blockchain like Spacemesh, equivocation is a serious offense that can have severe negative ramifications for the entire network, so this behavior cannot go unsanctioned. Once a miner\'s identity has been cancelled their PoST data is effectively useless. They must generate a new identity and reinitialize their PoST data. For more information, see Community Clarification: Equivocation.","sidebar":"start"},"start/smesher/networking":{"id":"start/smesher/networking","title":"Networking","description":"Most miners should never need to think much about their network settings.
