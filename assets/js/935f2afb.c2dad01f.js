In turn, this ledger contains an immutable record of every transaction that has ever occured using the cryptocurrency.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/economics":{"id":"learn/economics","title":"Spacemesh Economic Model","description":"The primary goal of Spacemesh is to make mining from home easy and economically sustainable over the long term. This means that home miners should not be \\"priced out\\" by large-scale, industrial \\"whale\\" mining operations with large economies of scale. While we cannot perfectly eliminate economies of scale--for instance, large scale operations will likely be able to acquire data storage more cheaply on a per-TB basis, and will likely have access to cheaper power--what we can do (and, indeed, have done) is level the playing field by introducing diseconomies of scale that favor home miners.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/epochs":{"id":"learn/epochs","title":"Storage and Epochs","description":""},"learn/hare":{"id":"learn/hare","title":"Hare","description":"Every five minutes the Spacemesh network fires a layer tick. The timing of this event is calculated locally, which is why it is critical that all Spacemesh nodes have synchronized clocks. After the layer tick event, there is a short delay after which the [[Hare]] consensus process kicks off for the layer that just ticked. The active set (i.e., the set of all valid Activation Transactions (ATXs) targeting the current epoch that a node is aware of) is sampled and a random committee of eligible, active smeshers is chosen to participate in the next Hare round. This sampling occurs relative to each smesher\'s weight in the current epoch, such that nodes with a greater weight are chosen more often. These nodes broadcast messages containing their opinion, or view, of the valid, ordered set of transactions to be included in this layer, and through several rounds of exchanging messages they eventually reach consensus on the canonical set of transactions for this layer. At the end of a successful Hare instance, all honest participants agree on the set of transactions to be included in the layer, and all honest nodes that observed Hare (but didn\'t themselves participate) also agree on the same. As a result, all nodes are able to independently construct a block containing these transactions in the canonical order.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/learn":{"id":"learn/learn","title":"Learn","description":"Test"},"learn/poet":{"id":"learn/poet","title":"PoET (Proof of Elapsed Time)","description":"In order to serve as a proof of space and time, the proof of space needs to be linked to a proof of time. Spacemesh uses a construction called proof of elapsed time (PoET) for this purpose. As with the other sections above, the details of this process are beyond the scope of this document, but in brief the PoET performs a type of cryptographic work that must be done sequentially, i.e., it cannot be parallelized. By proving that it\'s done a certain amount of work, it can therefore prove that a certain amount of real time has passed: in other words, a proof of sequential work serves as a proof of elapsed time.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/post":{"id":"learn/post","title":"PoST (Proof of Space-time)","description":"In order to become eligible to mine coins, miners of cryptocurrencies need to prove that they\u2019ve expended a scarce resource in service of the protocol. This is what we call the \u201cconsensus mechanism\u201d. You may already be familiar with the most famous of these, Proof of Work, where miners must cryptographically prove that they\u2019ve done the expensive work of  solving extremely complex math problems (this is, in effect, how Bitcoin mining works).","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/rewards":{"id":"learn/rewards","title":"Rewards","description":"Rewards","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/smeshing":{"id":"learn/smeshing","title":"What is Smeshing?","description":"In short, smeshing is mining. Similar to Bitcoin and other public blockchains, smeshing is the process of dedicating scarce resources to the Spacemesh network in exchange for eligibility to produce proposals and earn rewards. At a high level, mining in Spacemesh works like it does in other blockchains: smeshers provably spend scarce resources in order to obtain eligibilities to participate in block production at certain points in time, are rewarded with coins for following the rules of the protocol and contributing to block production, and are punished for violating these rules.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/spacemesh":{"id":"learn/spacemesh","title":"What Is Spacemesh?","description":"Spacemesh is a decentralized peer-to-peer network which serves as a public ledger to allow for the transaction of cryptographic assets including coins. It features a novel, robust consensus algorithm, making it highly secure and censorship resistant, while also being environment-friendly and offering a low barrier to entry for those wanting to participate in securing the network and earning rewards.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/tortoise":{"id":"learn/tortoise","title":"Tortoise","description":"A different set of eligible, active smeshers votes on the outcome of the Hare and the canonical state of the layer. This voting also happens on the basis of the active set and each smesher\'s weight relative to the total weight of all eligible smeshers in the epoch, i.e., the total epoch weight. A smesher with 2x the weight will receive 2x the eligibilities in a given epoch. These votes are encoded into messages known as proposals, and smeshers receive rewards for successfully submitting valid proposals in their eligible slots.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/transactions":{"id":"learn/transactions","title":"Transactions","description":""},"node_operation/blacklisting":{"id":"node_operation/blacklisting","title":"Blacklisting","description":"","sidebar":"node"},"node_operation/construction-node":{"id":"node_operation/construction-node","title":"Under Construction","description":"You may notice a lot of blank pages here.
