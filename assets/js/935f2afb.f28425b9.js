The idea is to re-architect the internal modules in go-spacemesh, isolating the smeshing logic from the passive consensus code. By dividing the node along these lines, we can enable users to run the lightweight yet sensitive (requiring access to the private key) smeshing logic separately from the rest of the node.

This transaction includes the smesher\u2019s PoST, their wallet address (to which rewards will go), and some other data. The ATX is then used to calculate the smesher\'s eligibility to participate in the rewards. For all subsequent epochs, the PoET service uses ATXs as the challenge value instead of the initial PoSp.

This means that home miners should not be \\"priced out\\" by large-scale, industrial \\"whale\\" mining operations with large economies of scale. While we cannot perfectly eliminate economies of scale--for instance, large scale operations will likely be able to acquire data storage more cheaply on a per-TB basis, and will likely have access to cheaper power--what we can do (and, indeed, have done) is level the playing field by introducing diseconomies of scale that favor home miners.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/epochs":{"id":"learn/epochs","title":"Storage and Epochs","description":""},"learn/hare":{"id":"learn/hare","title":"Hare","description":"hare","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/poet":{"id":"learn/poet","title":"PoET Servers","description":"Calculating the PoET requires performing repeated, computationally intensive calculations. Such work cannot be parallelized and must be performed sequentially, using the previous output as the input for the next iteration. As a result, PoET generation is not performed by individual smeshers but by specialized PoET servers. Many smeshers can rely on a single PoET server to generate a PoET for them. Ultimately, by chaining together proofs of space with proofs of elapsed time, a smesher is able to cryptographically prove to the network that they have committed a certain amount of space-time to the network, thereby asserting their eligibility to participate in the consensus and earn rewards.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/post":{"id":"learn/post","title":"PoST (Proof of Space-Time)","description":"The Proof of Space-Time (PoST) is a cornerstone of the consensus algorithm used by the Spacemesh protocol. Put simply, PoST is used to ensure that a smesher reserves a given amount of storage space for a given period of time. In this blog post, we will explore PoST along with its various constituents. In the end, you should have a good understanding of what PoST is, what it does, and how it works.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/rewards":{"id":"learn/rewards","title":"Rewards","description":"Like other, similar blockchains, there are two components to rewards in Spacemesh: newly minted coins, i.e., the block subsidy, and fees collected from transactions included in the block.

Similar to Bitcoin and other public blockchains, smeshing is the process of dedicating scarce resources to the Spacemesh network in exchange for eligibility to produce proposals and earn rewards. At a high level, mining in Spacemesh works like it does in other blockchains: smeshers provably spend scarce resources in order to obtain eligibilities to participate in block production at certain points in time, are rewarded with coins for following the rules of the protocol and contributing to block production, and are punished for violating these rules.","sidebar":"learn"},"learn/spacemesh":{"id":"learn/spacemesh","title":"What Is Spacemesh?","description":"Spacemesh is a decentralized peer-to-peer network which serves as a public ledger to allow for the transaction of cryptographic assets including coins.

The API is split into two separate instances, one public and one private, each of which implements several services that can be turned on or off at will. \\"Public\\" services provide read-only access to data such as node status, epochs/layers/blocks/transactions, account state, etc., whereas \\"private\\" services allow the operator to change the params of a running node, e.g., the smesher coinbase or the set of PoET servers. While \\"public\\" endpoints are theoretically safe to open for public API calls, in practice, we strongly recommend that no API services be exposed publicly. The API design and implementation have not been hardened against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and represent an attack vector against a running node. For this reason, you should run both the public and private API instances on private interfaces (e.g., the loopback/127.0.0.1 interface) and/or put them behind a firewall.","sidebar":"start"},"start/smeshing/smeshing_adv/equivocation":{"id":"start/smeshing/smeshing_adv/equivocation","title":"Avoiding Equivocation","description":"There is a very small set of behaviors that a smesher in Spacemesh is punished for.

This process is referred to as \\"syncing\\" and is a pre-requisite to running a full or a smeshing node. Historically, it has been difficult for smeshers to successfully sync their nodes owing to how time consuming the syncing process is. Primarily, syncing includes downloading and independently verifying all blocks, transactions, ATXs, along with some other data, and reconstructing the current state from scratch. Naturally, this took the average smesher a lot of time. As such, in response to the growing difficulty of syncing a fresh node, we have prepared a way to speed up the syncing process.
