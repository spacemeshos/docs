For a miner running her node on a computer that she already owns and uses every day, on a home Internet connection that she already has, the marginal cost is effectively zero. More precisely, the marginal cost is the cost of the GPU-based PoST initialization (which amortizes to zero over time), and the cost of keeping the computer turned on and online all the time rather than during the hours she'd normally use it.
