title: What Is Spacemesh?
---

Spacemesh is a layer one cryptocurrency platform that puts home miners first.

Spacemesh uses idle data storage as the basis of its Proof of Space-Time consensus mechanism, rather than more energy-intensive forms of mining. This, coupled with a uniquely race-free approach to blockchain, makes Spacemesh the ideal cryptocurrency platform for small-scale home miners. It's greener, fairer, and easier to use.

# History

Spacemesh was founded in 2017 by Tomer Afek, Aviv Eyal, and Rami Kasterstein, and based on the research of cryptographers Tal Moran and Ilan Orlovâ€”who invented the Proof of Space Time consensus mechanism in 2016.

# Our Mission

We believe that a decentralized world is a better world, and to that end, we want to bring cryptocurrency to the masses on a scale never before achieved. So far, the people who truly need cryptocurrency the most are the ones who have the least access to it. With a user-friendly application and fair reward distrubition for home miners with run-of-the-mill equipment, we hope to change that.
