title: What Is Cryptocurrency?
---

A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is secured by a cryptographically-encrypted ledger called a blockchain. In turn, this ledger contains an immutable record of every transaction that has ever occured using the cryptocurrency.

## What Makes Cryptocurrency Important

The move to digital currency has been happening since the dawn of the Internet. But these are just digital representations of existing fiat currencies, and are not a true shift from the existing status quo of our financial and monetary systems.

Banks and governments still control these assets.

But cryptocurrency is something new: a decentralized currency that no single entity or group controls.

It is also fully anonymous. Transactions are recorded on the public ledger, but the identities of the parties involved are not revealed.

This represents a complete paradigm shift.
