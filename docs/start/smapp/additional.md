# Toggling Dark Mode and Auto Start

The Spacemesh App includes settings that can be toggled in order to alter your user experience, including `DARK MODE` and `AUTO START`.

You can access these settings by navigating to the `SETTINGS` screen and scrolling down to `DARK MODE` and `WALLET AUTO START`.

# Switching to Wallet-Only Mode

If you didn't start Smapp in wallet-only mode, you can choose to do so through `SETTINGS`. In wallet-only mode, you can use your wallet to manage your balance and send transactions, but you will not receive any rewards from smeshing.

Go to the `SETTINGS` screen and click on `WALLETS` in the navigation bar. Then click on `SWITCH TO WALLET ONLY`.

This will take you to a screen where you can select the API to connect the wallet to.

Since you've already set up your wallet, after choosing the API you want, you will be prompted to enter your password.

After doing so, you will be taken back to your wallet.
