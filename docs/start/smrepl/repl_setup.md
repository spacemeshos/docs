## Overview

SMRepl is a basic reference Spacemesh wallet and a full node manager command line REPL.

Smrepl is designed to work together with a locally running go-spacemesh full node or with the public Spacemesh API.

Target users are developers who want to hack on the Spacemesh platform and Spacemesh devnet or testnet users who are comfortable with terminal apps and REPLs.
