All the resources you need to start using the Spacemesh network.

## Choose Your Interface

There are two ways to start interacting with the Spacemesh network: our GUI, Smapp, or our command-line repl, SMRepl.

### Smapp

Smapp is recommended for most users, since it's extremely user friendly and doesn't require any specialized technical knowledge.

However, if your system doesn't meet the minimum [system requirements](start/smapp/requirements), or you're interested in a more granular, technical approach, then our other interface may be better for you.

### SMRepl

SMRepl is a Spacemesh API client with wallet functions that operates via command-line.

**The SMRepl guide is currently under construction but will be available soon.**
