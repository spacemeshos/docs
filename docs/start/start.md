All the resources you need to start using the Spacemesh network.

## Choose Your Interface

There are two ways to start interacting with the Spacemesh network: our GUI, Smapp, or our command-line repl, SMRepl.

### Smapp

Smapp is recommended for most users, since it's extremely user friendly and doesn't require any specialized technical knowledge.

However, if your system doesn't meet the minimum [system requirements](start/smapp/requirements), or you're interested in a more granular, technical approach, then our other interface may be better for you.

### CLI

It's possible to run a Spacemesh node entirely from the command line using the [go-spacemesh](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh) full node implementation. You can run a pre-compiled [binary release](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/releases) for your platform, or you can compile the application yourself.

## General Smesher Guide

For more advanced users, our [Smesher Guide](start/smesher) will help you refine your node's performance and troubleshoot issues.
