## Backing up

There are three ways to get to the Wallet Backup Screen:

### OPTION 1

From the main screen. Note that until the first backup is done, there will be an alert under the “BALANCE” section saying “BACKUP YOUR WALLET”.

### OPTION 2

In the top right corner of the main screen, there is the `SETTINGS` button. After navigating to the settings, find the `WALLETS` option in the left menu, then scroll down until you see the **Backup Wallet** section. Once there, click the `BACKUP NOW` button.

Now, you are at the Wallet Backup Options screen:

At this stage, you will have two ways to back up your wallet: **File Backup** and **12 Words Backup**.

#### File Backup

Click on the `FILE BACKUP` button and you will be taken to the file backup screen:

Clicking on the `Browse file location` button will open a file browser window with the Wallet backup file selected. The file is saved in the “Documents” folder by default but can be moved to any other folder or the ledger wallet.

#### Option `MNEMONIC BACKUP`

Click the `MNEMONIC BACKUP` button and you will be taken to the mnemonic backup screen:

These 12 words can be used to restore your Wallet anywhere using Spacemesh software. They are also referred to as **seed** or **seed words**. By clicking the `PRINT WORDS` button, a standard print window will open, allowing you to either save the words as a PDF on your computer or print them on paper.

The other button is `COPY WORDS`. This option is useful if you want to save the words in some kind of encrypted file or vault. After clicking the `COPY WORDS` button, you will see a message in green confirming that the words have been copied to the clipboard.

Use any of the above two options to create a backup of your wallet. Once done, clicking `NEXT` will take you to the confirmation screen.

#### Confirmation Screen

On the confirmation screen, you can practice restoring the 12 words in the right order by dragging and dropping the randomly selected 4 words in the right places.

If you manage to place the words in the right order, you will be able to click `DONE` and will be returned to the Wallet screen. However, if you fail to do so, the following message will be shown beside the `TRY AGAIN` button:
