# Athena PoC Devnet

We are running a devnet named `devnet-athena-13` to demonstrate the Athena VM PoC.

The config for this devnet is located [here](https://configs.spacemesh.network/config.devnet-athena-13.json). Please note that the mainline go-spacemesh is NOT compatible with this network - you need to use the `athena-devnet` version of go-spacemesh. Currently, the most recent version is `athena-devnet-13-1.0.1`, located [here](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/releases/tag/athena-devnet-13-1.0.1).

The explorer is accessible [here](https://explorer-devnet-athena.spacemesh.network/overview).

A smart contract template and short guide are located [here](https://github.com/athenavm/athena/blob/main/examples/contract_template/README.md).
