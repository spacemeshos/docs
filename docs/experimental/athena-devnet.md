# Athena PoC Devnet

We're excited to showcase the Athena VM Proof of Concept through our latest devnet, `devnet-athena-13`.

This devnet represents an innovative Proof of Concept integration in go-spacemesh, featuring Athena (on L1) as a replacement for the genesis VM. While this marks an exciting milestone, please note that we're still working diligently to prepare Athena for integration into the main network.

To help you get started, we've prepared a comprehensive smart contract template and guide, which you can find [here](https://github.com/athenavm/athena/blob/main/examples/contract_template/README.md).

The devnet configuration is available [here](https://configs.spacemesh.network/config.devnet-athena-13.json). Important note: You'll need to use the specialized `athena-devnet` version of go-spacemesh, as the mainline version is not compatible with this network. The latest release (version `athena-devnet-13-1.0.1`) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/releases/tag/athena-devnet-13-1.0.1).

You can explore the network in real-time through our web interface [here](https://explorer-devnet-athena.spacemesh.network/overview).
